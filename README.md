# PalindromeCheckerApp
PalindromeCheckerApp
Objective
The primary objective of this application is to determine whether a given input string or number is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backward). This serves as a foundational project to demonstrate basic string manipulation, conditional logic, and user input handling in the chosen programming language.
Topics Covered
This project covers several core programming topics:
Input/Output (I/O): Handling user input and displaying results.
String Manipulation: Reversing strings, comparing strings, and handling different data types.
Control Flow: Using conditional statements (if/else) to decide the output.
Functions/Methods: Structuring the checking logic into reusable functions.
Which Use Case
This application is ideal for:
Educational Purposes: A simple exercise for beginners learning a new programming language.
Code Snippet: A quick utility for developers needing to check if a specific string is a palindrome within a larger system.
Interview Preparation: A common technical interview question to assess basic algorithmic thinking.
Flow of Project
Start: The application prompts the user for input.
Input: The user provides a string or number.
Process: The input is cleaned (e.g., removing spaces/punctuation, converting to lowercase) and reversed.
Compare: The original cleaned input is compared with the reversed input.
Output: The application displays a message indicating whether the input is a palindrome or not.
Running Procedure
To run the application:
Clone the Repository:
Code

    git clone [repository_url]
Navigate to the Directory:
Code

    cd PalindromeCheckerApp
Run the Application: (Assuming Java  as an example)
Code

    App main.java
Follow Prompts: Enter the text you wish to check when prompted by the application.
